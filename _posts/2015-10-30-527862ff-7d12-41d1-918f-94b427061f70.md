We are very excited to introduce our new wedding and event information page. Everything about wedding photography and New Jersey venues that we are currently working with.  We will also be writing about our brides and grooms following along before, during and after the ceremony with  a final wrap up including clients thoughts and experience.   

If you're currently engaged and interested in participating we are offering a free upgrade on most of our current [packages][0] for the first engaged couple willing to be our featured event.  

Very much looking forward to seeing you all here.

Jason
